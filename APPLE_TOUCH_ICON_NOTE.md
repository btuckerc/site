# Apple Touch Icon Note

## Action Required

The `index.html` file references `/apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180 pixels) for iOS devices.

**Current Status:** This file does not exist yet.

**To complete SEO optimization:**

1. Create a 180x180 PNG image (square format)
2. Save it as `apple-touch-icon.png` in the `public/` folder
3. The image should be your profile picture or website logo
4. Ensure it looks good at that size (iOS will automatically add rounded corners and shine effect)

**Recommendation:** Use your avatar image (`avatar-336.png` or `avatar-672.png`) as a base and resize it to 180x180 pixels. You can use tools like:
- ImageMagick: `convert avatar-336.png -resize 180x180 apple-touch-icon.png`
- Online tools: Remove.bg, Canva, or any image editor
- macOS Preview: Open avatar, Tools > Adjust Size, set to 180x180, Export as PNG

Once the file is created, the SEO optimization will be complete!
